3. Live updates as analysis completes

---

## 🤖 AI Analysis System

### Concept: Analysis Tasks (Not "Schemas")

**User Mental Model:** "Filters I can apply to organize my library"

**Technical Reality:** Pydantic schemas sent to Gemini API

**User never sees:** "Schema", "Fields", "JSONB", "Extraction"

---

### Creating an Analysis

**Option 1: AI-Guided Chat**

```
User: Clicks "Create New Filter"

AI: "What would you like to know about your videos?
     💡 Not sure? I can suggest some ideas."

[Button: "Show me examples"] [Button: "I know what I want"]

User clicks "Show me examples"

AI: "Here are some useful filters people create:

     📊 Content Quality
     - Real tutorial vs clickbait
     - Production quality
     - Teaching style

     🎯 Learning Focus
     - Difficulty level
     - Prerequisites needed
     - What you'll actually learn

     ⏱️ Time Investment
     - Estimated learning time
     - Watch vs practice ratio

     Which sounds useful?"

User: "I want to know if it's clickbait and the difficulty level"

AI: "Perfect! Let me set that up...

     ✓ Clickbait Detection
       Checks if title matches content

     ✓ Difficulty Assessment
       Options: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced

     Should I apply this to all your videos or just specific topics?"

User: "Just my Python videos"

AI: "Got it! Analyzing 23 Python videos now..."
```

**Option 2: Manual Form Mode**

```
User switches to "Manual Mode"

Form appears:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

### Analysis Pipeline

**Two Types of Data:**

#### 1. Instant (No AI)
From YouTube API:
- Title
- Channel name
- Duration
- Thumbnail
- Publication date
- View count
- Description

**User sees immediately** when video is added.

---

#### 2. AI-Analyzed (Background)
From Gemini API:
- Clickbait detection
- Difficulty level
- Content categories
- Prerequisites
- What you'll learn
- Teaching style
- Quality assessment
- Hidden marketing detection
- Custom analyses

**User sees progressively** as analysis completes.

---

### Analysis Task Architecture

**Key Principle:** One task = one question = one API call

**Example Tasks:**

```
Task 1: "Is this clickbait?"
└─ Returns: boolean + confidence

Task 2: "What's the difficulty level?"
└─ Returns: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced"

Task 3: "What will I learn from this?"
└─ Returns: string[] (list of concepts)

Task 4: "Is this pure content marketing?"
└─ Returns: boolean + reasoning
```

**Workflow Types:**

- **Parallel:** All tasks run at once (faster, more API calls)
- **Sequential:** Tasks run in order (slower, dependency support)

**User Control:**
- Apply analysis to all videos or specific tags
- Enable/disable analyses per collection
- See cost estimates before running

---

### Custom Fields (User-Defined)

Beyond AI analyses, users can add manual fields:

```
⭐ Star Rating (1-5)
👍 Presentation Style (Like/Neutral/Dislike)
📝 Personal Notes
✅ Watched Status
🔖 Bookmarked
```

These appear alongside AI-generated data in the interface.

---

## 💬 Chat With Your Library

**Conversational Discovery:**

```
User: "I want to become a Python developer and build AI apps"

AI: "Great goal! I can help you plan a learning path.
     Based on your library, here's a 3-month plan:

     Month 1: Python Fundamentals (5 videos, ~8 hours)
     └─ Start with 'Python Basics' by Corey Schafer
     └─ Then 'Data Structures' by Tech With Tim

     Month 2: Web Development (8 videos, ~15 hours)
     └─ FastAPI tutorial series
     └─ Database basics

     Month 3: AI Integration (12 videos, ~20 hours)
     └─ LangChain fundamentals
     └─ Build your first AI agent

     Want me to create a playlist in this order?"
```

**Smart Recommendations:**

```
User: "Show me videos about agentic coding workflows"

AI: "Found 3 videos in your library + I can suggest 5 more
     from channels you like. Want me to add them?"

User: "Yes, add the good ones"

AI: "Added 3 videos. Skipped 2 that were mostly ads.
     Analyzing them now..."
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Model Changes

**Current (Lists):**
```
List 1 → Videos [A, B, C]
List 2 → Videos [D, E, F]
```

**New (Tags):**
```
All Videos [A, B, C, D, E, F]
├─ Video A: tags=[Python, Tutorial, Beginner]
├─ Video B: tags=[Python, Project, Advanced]
├─ Video C: tags=[JavaScript, Tutorial]
└─ ...

Sidebar shows tag filters, clicking filters the view.
```

**Key Changes:**
- Add `tags` table
- Many-to-many relationship with videos
- Lists become saved tag combinations (optional)
- Single video pool with flexible filtering

---

### Analysis Task Model

**New Table: `analysis_tasks`**
```sql
id: UUID
name: str                  -- "Clickbait Detection"
description: str           -- User-friendly explanation
question: str              -- Prompt for Gemini
expected_schema: JSONB     -- Pydantic schema definition
applies_to_tags: str[]     -- Which tags to analyze
is_active: bool            -- Can be toggled on/off
execution_order: int       -- For sequential workflows
created_by_user: UUID
```

**New Table: `analysis_results`**
```sql
id: UUID
video_id: UUID
task_id: UUID
result: JSONB              -- Structured Gemini output
confidence: float          -- AI confidence score
analyzed_at: datetime

```

**Benefits:**
- Flexible: user-defined analyses
- Trackable: see what was analyzed when
- Cost-aware: know what each analysis costs
- Reusable: same task for multiple videos

   - Hide the complexity, show the magic

2. **YouTube users expect YouTube UX**
   - Grid view is non-negotiable
   - Thumbnails must be prominent
   - Navigation must feel familiar

3. **Onboarding makes or breaks adoption**
   - 30 seconds to "wow" or users leave
   - Pre-loading content during onboarding is key
   - AI chat lowers barrier to entry

4. **Tags > Lists for flexibility**
   - One video, many contexts
   - Filter combinations more powerful
   - Matches how people think

5. **Analysis pipeline must be invisible**
   - Auto-rate limiting
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Live updates without page refresh
   - Cost-aware but not user-configured
