## Purpose

This document defines the **absolute minimum functionality** required for MVP.
No bells and whistles - only features essential for the core value proposition.

**Note:** ALL deferred features are documented in `feature-roadmap.md` - nothing gets lost!

## Explicitly Out of MVP

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Deferred features are fully documented in `feature-roadmap.md`

This section is a **quick reference only** - see roadmap for complete details:

- [ ] [Feature name] → Phase 2 - [Brief reason]
- [ ] [Feature name] → Phase 3 - [Brief reason]
- [ ] [Feature name] → Backlog - [Brief reason]

## Technical Requirements (High-Level)

**Data Storage:**
[What data needs to persist?]

**Authentication (if needed):**
[Yes/No? If yes, what level?]

**External Integrations:**
[Any third-party services required for core functionality?]

**Performance Requirements:**
[Any critical performance constraints?]

---

## Success Metric

**The MVP is successful if:**

[Define 1-2 measurable criteria that prove the core functionalities work]

## Build Order Priority

Based on dependencies, build in this order:

1. [Functionality] - Why first: [reason]
2. [Functionality] - Why second: [reason]
3. [Functionality] - Why third: [reason]
